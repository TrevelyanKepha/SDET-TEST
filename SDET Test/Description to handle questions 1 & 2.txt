1) 
To silenty execute the Install-TextEditor function the Start-Process cmdlet should be:
-Start-Process -FilePath $SetupFileLocation -ArgumentList '/S' -Verb runas -Wait  
to run the .exe file as administrator and accept no inputs until it is completed.


2)
For a scenario where the installation fails an else statement with the parameters when the retry installation count goes above 10 or the file path is not valid
should be created which will execute when the boolean expression is $False and thus be caught as an exception to trigger the Write-Error cmdlet 


Logs:
For instances of a successful installation the Write-Output cmdlet could be used to make the end user aware if one wishes to do so.
For failed installations the Write-Error cmdlet displays the failed operation.
Write-Information cmdlet should remain as is because $InformationPreference variable is still set to its default, SilentlyContinue since the script places emphasis on
silence.

To ensure validity of data eg paths, .exe files throughout the execution of the script:
One should use the Test-Path cmdlet to check whether the path and .exe file exists
If any are missing, the cmdlet returns $False. Otherwise, it returns $True.
